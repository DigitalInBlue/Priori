It does require a modern \r\ncompiler (Visual C++ 2012 or GCC 4.7+) due to its use of C++11.\r\n\r\nPriori is a special base class which facilitates a very fast dynamic_cast<>\r\nalternative when dynamic_cast<> itself has shown to be a bottleneck. Specifically \r\nin the case where dynamic_cast<> from a base class to a derived class is impacting\r\nperformance, priori_cast<> costs 85% less than dynamic_cast<>.  When \r\ncasting from a derived type to a base class, priori_cast<> costs about 4x more than\r\ndynamic_cast, so the performance benefit should be weighed prior to utilization.\r\n\r\n(Given the later case of casting from a derived type to a base type, I would suggest\r\nusing static_cast<> anyway.)\r\n\r\n![Image](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/DigitalInBlue/Priori/trend.png?raw=true)\r\n","google":"UA-41889926-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
